public class q02 {
    //Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter the number of elements in an array
    // and then input the elements of the array.
    // The program should call a method named minGap,
    // which accepts the array as a parameter and
    // calculates the minimum gap between adjacent elements,
    // defined as the absolute difference between consecutive elements.
    // If the array contains fewer than 2 elements, the method should return 0.
    // The main method should display the result returned by minGap.
    // For example, if the user enters the array {1, 3, 6, 5, 12},
    // the gaps are 2 (3 - 1), 3 (6 - 3), 1 (6 - 5), and 7 (12 - 5),
    // so minGap should return 1.
